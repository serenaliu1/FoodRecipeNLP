# FoodReceipeNLP

Food is an essential part of everyday life, for every person on the planet and it is something that is shared between countries, communities, and individuals breaking down boundaries between cultures, connecting different places and histories. Each cuisine exhibits unique and distinguishing features that make them unmistakable to both the eyes and the palate. Thus, the question of what defines a cuisine, becomes one of extreme interest.

In this NLP study, we aim to perform supervised learning to classify cuisines and to use the cosine similarity measure to investigate the underlying relationships between different types of cuisine.
